Let me know what's on your mind
Let me know what I'm gon' find
It's all in time, show me how to teach the mind
Show me how to reach the blind (Lord, give me a sign!)
Show me what I gotsta do to bring me closer to you
Cause I'ma go through whatever you want me to
Just let me know what to do (Lord, give me a sign!)
